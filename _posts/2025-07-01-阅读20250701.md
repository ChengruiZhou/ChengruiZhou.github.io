#### The 5G location service architecture comprises four main components across all releases . 

1. #### UE, which is capable of receiving the positioning reference signal (PRS) and/or transmitting the sounding reference signal (SRS). In addition, some UEs are capable of conducting physical-layer measurements, reporting them to the 5G core network (5GC), and computing their location. 

2. #### The RAN (NG-RAN), where the serving gNodeB (gNB) allocates the physical resources of the corresponding PRS, receives SRS and/or transmits PRS, conducts physical-layer measurements and reports them to the location server. 

3. ####  The location server, which is an entity in the 5GC called location management function (LMF), its function is to initiate the positioning process, communicate with the UE or the RAN, receive the reported physical-layer measurements, and compute the UE’s location. 

4. ####  location service client (LSC), which connects thirdparty applications to the core network and provides customers with location service through open application programming interfaces (APIs), such as real-time location push, map management, track query, and location data analysis [25].
